5) handle_addition_of_new_software:
write a function in dbms to add a new hardware resource in the table. All required fields are passed into the function in the UI.
handle_addition_of_new_software(s_id, s_name , s_desc , s_key , s_docs , s_alloc_status)

6) Handle hardware updation: 
write a function/procedure in dbms to update a hardware resource. 
It takes the same inputs as the create function but instead of creating a new resource , we update the respective fields in the table. 
handle_hardware_updation(h_id, h_name , h_desc , h_use , h_alloc_status)

7) handle software updation: 
handle_software_updation(s_id, s_name , s_desc , s_key , s_docs , s_alloc_status)
write a function/procedure in dbms to update a software resource.
it takes the same inputs as the function for creation. but instead of creating, we update the resource.
